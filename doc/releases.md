Releases
--------

**IMPORTANT:** As of version 3.0.0, this plugin no longer works with Liquibase versions prior to
4.24, and it requires liquibase to be in the `buildscript` classpath, in addition to the 
`liquibaseRuntime` dependency.

**IMPORTANT:** As of version 2.2.0, this plugin no longer works with Gradle versions prior to 6.4.

**IMPORTANT:** Using version 2.1.0+ of this plugin with Liquibase 4.4.0+ requires additional 
configuration.  Liquibase now uses the picocli library to parse options, but for some reason that
library isn't a transitive dependency of Liquibase itself, so if you want to use this plugin with
Liquibase 4.4.0+, you'll have to add the `liquibaseRuntime 'info.picocli:picocli:4.6.1'` dependency
to your build.gradle file.

This page gives the highlights newer releases.  For complete details of each release, including 
older releases, see the [changelog](./changelog.md).

### Release 3.0.0 (July 15, 2024)

- This release finally supports the latest versions of Liquibase, but **NO LONGER SUPPORTS VERSIONS
  OLDER THAN 4.24**.  

- Liquibase now gets the list of tasks to create from Liquibase itself, which means it needs to a
  classpath dependency in the `buildscript` block.  This is in addition to being a 
  `liquibaseRuntime` dependency as before.

- The plugin no longer fixes liquibase  arguments.  What you give it is what will be passed to 
  Liquibase.  This makes the plugin more flexible as Liquibase changes, but will break if you are
  still using old arguments.  You will need to fix the following, if you are still using them.

  | old name                       | new name                       |
  |--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
  | changeLogFile                  | changelogFile                  |
  | changeLogParameters            | changelogParameters            |
  | databaseChangeLogLockTableName | databaseChangelogLockTableName |
  | databaseChangeLogTableName     | databaseChangelogTableName     |
  | liquibaseHubApiKey             | hubApiKey                      |
  | liquibaseHubUrl                | hubUrl                         |
  | liquibaseProLicenseKey         | proLicenseKey                  |

  The most important change is `changeLogFile`, which is now `changelogFile`.

- Commands in newer versions of Liquibase no longer have "values" at the end.  All options are 
  now passed in as regular arguments.  This both simplifies the plugin, and makes it more flexible.
  The `liquibasecommandValue` and `liquibaseExtraArguments` Gradle properties have been removed,
  and you can supply the value of any valid Liquibase argument by setting a matching Gradle
  property, prefixed with `liquibase`.  for example to run the "tag" task, you can now run
  `gradlew tag -PliquibaseTag=myTag`.  This also works to override values given in an `activity`
  block.

  Changelog Parameters can also be supplied this way, but because Gradle only lets you specify a 
  property once, all parameters need to be in the same property.  For example, 
  `-PliquibaseChangelogParameters=parm1=value1,param2=value2`, etc.  This plugin will merge the
  parameters given on the command line with the ones in an activity block.

- The `executeSqlFile` command has been removed.  Use the `executeSql` command with a `sqlFfile` 
  argument instead.

- Liquibase's arguments can have aliases.  If you specify both an argument and an alias, you're on
  your own.

- The plugin will ignore arguments that Liquibase doesn't recognize.  This is done for two reasons:
  1. Arguments in an `activity` block are meant to be defaults.  Not all commands support all 
    arguments, and it is not an error to skip the ones that don't apply to the command you are 
    running at the moment.
  2. Arguments specified as properties on the Gradle command line start with `liquibase`, but not 
    all properties that start with `liquibase` are meant to be command arguments.  For example,
    you could use a `liquibaseVersion` property to configure Gradle.  This property is not meant to
    be used by Liquibase.  By default, the plugin will ignore them silently, but running Gradle with
    the `--debug` flag will enable logging that shows what properties are being ignored. 

### Release 2.2.2 (April 27, 2024)

- Added support for the label-filter, labels, adn contexts command arguments to the
  `markNextChangeSetRan` and `markNextChangeSetRanSql` tasks, with thanks to @Tylorjg

### Release 2.2.1 (November 19, 2023)

- Added support for the `author` argument of the `diffChangeLog` and `generateChangeLog` commands
  with thanks to @EggOxygen.

### Release 2.2.0 (March 4, 2023)

**Release 2.2.0 has some important and potentially breaking changes.**

- Gradle 8 is supported, versions prior to 6.4 are no longer supported.

- The older plugin id is no longer supported.  To apply this plugin now, you must use  
  `org.liquibase.gradle`.

- The plugin creates tasks that line up with the newer Liquibase 4.4+ commands.  To create tasks
  that match the older pre 4.4 commands, to support backwards compatibility in CI/CD pipelines for
  example, simply add `-PliquibaseCreateLegacyTasks` to the gradle command.  This can be done
  regardless of the version of Liquibase being used.  This support will be removed in the future.
  It is helpful to keep in mind that while it is convenient for the task to match the Liquibase
  commands, it is not necessary, so Liquibase 4.4 tasks can still be used with older versions of
  Liquibase, the plugin will translate commands and arguments automatically.

- There is a new `executeSqlFile` task for executing SQL from a file.  The `executeSql` task now
  only executes the SQL given in the `liquibaseCommandValue` property, and `executeSqlFile` executes
  the SQL given in the filename specified by the `liquibaseCommandValue` property.

- The plugin now sends the newer kebab case commands to Liquibase when it detects newer versions in
  of Liquibase in the classpath.  For example, it uses `drop-all` when it detects version 4.4+
  instead of the legacy `dropAll` command that it sends to older versions of Liquibase.

- An output file can be specified on the command line, for tasks that use one, with the
  `-PliquibaseOutputFile=someFile` property.  This will override the `outputFile` specified in the
  `activity` block of your build.gradle file.

- There is a new `-PliquibaseExtraArguments` property that can be used to override the arguments
  that the plugin sends to Liquibase.

### Release 2.1.1 (December 20, 2021)

Fixed the Code that detects the version of liquibase in use at the time the liquibase tasks run.

### Release 2.1.0 (November 13, 2021)

Release 2.1.0 adds support for Liquibase 4.4.0 and 4.5.0. Liquibase 4.4.0 made extensive changes to
the way it processes command line arguments.  Liquibase now uses the picocli library to parse
options, but for some reason that library isn't a transitive dependency of Liquibase itself, so if
you want to use this plugin with Liquibase 4.4.0+, you'll have to add the
`liquibaseRuntime 'info.picocli:picocli:4.6.1'` dependency to your build.gradle file.

Liquibase now has 2 "Main" classes and this plugin chooses the best one based on the version of
Liquibase it detects.  You can still set a mainClassName, in the liquibase block of your
build.gradle file, but it will most likely fail in Liquibase 4.4+.

There is also a subtle change in the way "SQL" tasks get created.  Tasks that ended with "SQL" now
end with "Sql".  For example `updateSQL` is now `updateSql`.  Since neither Gradle nor Liquibase
seems to pay too much attention to case, this should not cause any breaking changes for now, but as
Liquibase itself transitions from camelCase commands to kebab case commands, this may become
important in the future, and this change will make it easier to pass the right thing to Liquibase if
and when Liquibase ever stops supporting camel case.
